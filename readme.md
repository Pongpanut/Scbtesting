From an assignment. I selected Quiz number 1 kub

1. Click SwappingApp.exe to lunch the program

2. Screen will display "Please input number of operation and number of iteration and put space as seperator" text

3. Please input number of operation and number of iteration with space as seperator
   Such as 4 2 means there is 4 operation per iteration with 2 iterations
   
4. After submitted, Te screen will show "Please input 1 operation" ... depend on How many operaion did you put in #3. The operation format will be pair of index that you want to swap such as "1 3" means number index 1 and 3 will be swapped.


   


Note: The complexity of this program is Big omega(kn) [k is #operation, n is #iteration].
        
      I have applied dynamic programming technique with top-down approach (Memoization).
	       
      I expect the complexity should reduced to O(kn)
